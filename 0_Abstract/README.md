# Title: AN IOT BASED SMART OUTDOOR PARKING SYSTEM
     The Internet of Things(IoT) is a large technical field that is actively being researched and implemented.
     Several Internet-of-Things(IoT) based technologies offer extra benefits while lowering labour costs. 
     As the world's population expands, so does the demand for transportation. As a result,the dependency on parking autos expands.
     People visiting public facilities in large cities, such as malls, parks, temples, and theatres, are finding it difficult to locate parking.Despite the existence of various established systems, the bulk of parking places are still controlled by hand.
     The only way to travel about in most smart cities is to use awel-organized indoor parking system.
     Regulations for automobile parking in the open air have yet to be created and implemented.Traditional parking methods are far too ineficient and inconvenient for metropolitan areas where it is difficult to find available spaces.
     This might result in a lot of traffic, small colisions, and public accidents.
     As a result, a smart outdoor parking system based on IoT(InternetofThings) and weigh bridge load sensors may be built for the organised, well- timed, flexible, easy, and safe parking of automobiles in public spaces.
